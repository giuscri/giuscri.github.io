        <p>Hi! I'm a Software Engineer.</p>

        <p>You can find my resume <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhvskNLiuBNDpjliqupbyVr0qOyvjjzXDZEcqkfPQ3g/edit?usp=sharing">on
        this Google Docs</a>. I'm based in Milan but <strong>I'm open to move to other countries</strong> for the
        right opportunity.</p>

        <p>I'm well-versed in many programming languages but I'm happier writing Python, Scala, Go or TypeScript.</p>
        
        <p>What I look for in new jobs opportunities is the possibility of becoming a better engineer.</p>

        <p>I'm currently working on <a href="https://banksealer.com/">fraud detection using Machine Learning</a>,
        microservices deployed to AWS and functional programming on the JVM.</p>

        <p>Want to chat? Feel free to drop me an email :)</p>
